# Retail dashboard

A retail dashboard is a performance tool to visualize and report all important retail KPIs in one central interface and turn this collected data into actionable insights. This repository consists of the R notebook that uses data from the online retailer Olist to perform visualisation of the important information in the resulting dashboard.
A very simple dashboard, that can be improved by adding more content, has been created based on the analysis.
